# San Juan Islands Orca Sightings service

This cloud-based service tracks the movements of orca pods around the San Juan Islands in the Salish Sea. Orcas are also known as killer whales.

Using this service, orca enthusiasts can report the location and time of their sightings off the coast of any of the San Juan Islands, making it easy for others to sight these whales from land so they don't have to charter a boat. As a developer, you can include this service in your app.

## User community

The orca whale watching community is niche but active. It includes a variety of enthusiasts from around the world, and many seek the orca that frequent the San Juan Islands. Whale watchers can see orca pods swim near the land there year-round. Their large dorsal fins make them easier to spot from far away than other whales or dolphins.
