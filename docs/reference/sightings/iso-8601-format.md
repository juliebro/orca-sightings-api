# What is ISO 8601 format?

*Written with help from Gemini 2.5 Flash.*

ISO 8601 is a widely used international standard for representing dates and times. It provides a consistent and unambiguous way to express dates and times, regardless of cultural differences or time zones.

## Key components of ISO 8601 used in the Orca Sightings service

- **YYYY-MM-DD:** Represents the date with four digits for the year, two for the month, and two for the day.
- **hh:mm:** Represents the time of day with two digits for the hour, and two for the minute. Uses a 24-hour clock.
- **T:** Separates the date and time components.

## Examples of ISO 8601 formats

- **YYYY-MM-DD:** 2025-01-27 (January 27, 2025)
- **YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:** 2025-05-18T14:30 (May 18, 2025, at 2:30 PM)

## Benefits of using ISO 8601

- **Unambiguous:** Eliminates the potential for confusion that can arise from different date formats in different cultures.
- **Standardized:** Provides a universally accepted format for representing dates and times.
- **Time zone aware:** Allows for precise representation of time, including UTC and offsets from UTC.
- **Computer-readable:** Easy to parse and process by computers and applications.
