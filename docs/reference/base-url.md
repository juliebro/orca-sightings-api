# Base URL

The base URL of the service is typically `https://localhost:3000` .

The API reference documents this as `{base_url}/users` or `{base_url}/sightings` for example. This is because you can configure the port number for `json-server` to something other than 3000.

If Orca Sightings were an actual cloud service, the URL would be something like `https://api.orca-sightings.com/v1` .
