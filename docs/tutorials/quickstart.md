# Get started: a tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to download the API files and try one of the service actions: viewing all the orca sightings reported in the app for the San Juan Islands. If you already have the required software, the process should take about 15 minutes.

## Required software

You'll need the following software installed on your computer before you can begin this tutorial:

* JSON Server to *info to come*.
* cURL or Postman to view the response. See *info to come*.
* *More info to come*.

## Step 1: Download the API files

The files are located in the [orca-sightings-api repo on GitHub](https://github.com/juliebro/orca-sightings-api/tree/main/api). The directory contains the following files:

*  `orca-sightings-db.json`: a JSON file containing example users and sightings.
*  `orca-sightings.sh`: a shell script that starts JSON Server. Use this for Linux or macOS.
*  `orca-sightings.bat`: a batch file that starts JSON Server. Use this for Windows.

## Step 2: Start JSON Server

*Info to come*

## Step 3: Use cURL or Postman to submit a request
