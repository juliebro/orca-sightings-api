# San Juan Islands Orca Sightings service

This cloud-based service tracks the movements of orca pods around the San Juan Islands in the Salish Sea. Orcas are also known as killer whales.

Using this service, orca enthusiasts can report the location and time of their sightings off the coast of any of the San Juan Islands, making it easy for others to sight these whales from land so they don't have to charter a boat. As a developer, you can include this service in your app.

## Features of the Orca Sightings service

This is a RESTful API service with `/users` and `/sightings` resources. Each resource allows the typical GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE actions, allowing you to include the following actions in your app:

* Create new users and sightings
* Find all or some of the users and sightings
* Update existing users and sightings
* Remove users and sightings
