# Style guide for orca-sightings-api docs

*Draft 1*

## Contractions

Always use them unless it makes the sentence awkward to read.

## Method/endpoint topics

Title should looks like this: 

`GET /sightings` retrieve all sightings

Notice that there's no colon after the endpoint and the description starts with lower case.
